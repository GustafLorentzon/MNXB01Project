This file serves as a place where any member of the team can add thoughts
and suggestions about what they want to do. Ideas may come up randomly
and not in the meeting, which is why this file exists.

- I have further edited the cleaner so to comply with tim's request. The cleaner now
prompts the user to ask if they would like the date and time in a separate file to the
temperatures and splits them accordingly. - 04/11/2020

- I have edited my cleaner to include headers for the different columns including date,
time and temperature. This is to aid Tom in his graphing code as they require headers to work.
I am now trying to aid in the finding of a way to graph dates. - 04/11/2020

- The file cleaner has been created, will upload shortly. The cleaner will first check
if a input parameter has been given, then detemine whether the file exists.
Next it determines whether this is one of the smhi files or the uppsala file
based on whether or not it finds 'Datum'. From here it cleans the file, For the
smhi files it is straightforward as a correction of homework 3. The uppsala file
is in a different format and as such is converted to the same format as the cleaned
smhi files. One potential worry is that while the smhi file has date in the form
1999-01-01 the uppsala file will give the same date as 1999-1-1. Futhermore the 
temperature in the uppsala file will display 0.4 as .4 . For the moment neither
of these pose problems so I will leave them in this form for now and correct if 
needed. - 02/11/2020

- Yesterday I worked on the graphing code. The intention is to give the user the ability to
choose what they're plotting against what. I've had a few negative thoughts about this though
namely that it might be irritating for analysis. But will hold a meeting today and discuss
with group what they think. It has only been tried on "play data" so far, so I'm slightly
concerned about using it on "real" data -- we'll see what happens. I also acknowledge
that it was probably a bad idea for me to not make a commit yesterday with the "so far"
working code. I will definitely put the code on Github today. - 04/11/2020

- It would be good for the graphing file to have two different functions.
Assume that the graphing file is called Grapher(). It would be good if Grapher
upon being executed, would ask the user which columns they want to compare
and graph. - 02/11/2020

- Checking GitHub repo
- Testing if I can push
- Yesterday worked on plotting data
- Created code that crates function that calls town
- Created TempCompHist.C that allows two years weather data to be plotted as hist gives them a fit and compares to the two years. Allows comparison between different years to see how global warming has affected different places in Sweden.
- Did some stuff on the report.
- Created a hist folder that has the data that is used for TempCompHist.C file.

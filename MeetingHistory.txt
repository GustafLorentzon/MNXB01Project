[Attendees: Tom, Sam]

Meeting Summary: 

Discussed who's bash script should be used to cleanse the data for analysis.

Concluded that Sam's BASH code was overall better received by grader, and
hence he will clear up his code and cleanse the files. 

In order to allow for Tom to work in-parallel, Tom will set up a script
which takes a cleansed file as input and produces a graph which displays
relevant data. 

Do not want multiple files/functions to do the same thing. Ideally only
one person writing the file that cleanses, one person writes the graph-
plotting code.

The following people have been delegated the following tasks:

(Sam)
- Work with BASH script from tutorial 3 in order to cleanse the raw data
files that we've been given. 
- Calculate the "average temperature" of Sweden through all documented
years. 

(Tom)
- Write a root file which takes a cleansed file as an input and produces
a graph. (Extra: Allow user to choose the axis' that they want to plot?)
- Write a root file that finds the maximum recorded temperature of each
year and plot the result.

Meeting Summary: 

The initial bottleneck of the project will be in "cleansing" the files. 
We had a look through the files and got an idea of what is required. 

The plan formed as of today is basically as follows:

(1) Complete the Root homeworks over the weekend.
(2) Meet up as a group on Monday and delegate work between us all,
however as mentioned, we can't really do a great deal until we all 
have the ability to open and use the files.
(3) Tom to set up a Github repository.
